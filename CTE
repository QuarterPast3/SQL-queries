These are some SQL queries with a common table expression (CTE):

This is the first CTE query:
WITH top_customers_cte
  AS (SELECT B.customer_id,
       B.first_name,
       B.last_name,
       D.city,
       E.country,
       SUM(a.amount) AS total_amount
      FROM payment A
      INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
      INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
      INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
      INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
      WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Shimoga','Aparecida de Goinia','Emeishan','Pontianak',
        'Tarsus', 'Atlixco','Zalantun','Rio Claro','Tokat')
      GROUP BY B.customer_id,
        B.first_name,
        B.last_name,
        D.city,
        E.country
     ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC
      LIMIT 5)

SELECT first_name,
	last_name,
	AVG(total_amount) AS avg_amount_paid
FROM top_customers_cte
GROUP BY first_name,
	last_name
ORDER BY avg_amount_paid DESC


Here is my second CTE query:
WITH top_customers_cte
AS (SELECT A.amount,
        SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid,
        B.customer_id,
        B.first_name,
        B.last_name,
        D.city,
        E.country
  FROM payment A
  INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
  INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
  INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
  INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
  WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Shimoga','Aparecida de Goinia','Emeishan','Pontianak','Tarsus','Atlixco','Zalantun','Rio Claro','Tokat')
  GROUP BY A.amount,
      B.customer_id,
      B.first_name,
      B.last_name,
      D.city,
      E.country
  ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC)

SELECT F.country,
	COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS top_customer_count,
	COUNT(DISTINCT C.customer_id) AS all_customer_count
FROM top_customers_cte A
INNER JOIN payment B ON A.amount = B.amount
INNER JOIN customer C ON B.customer_id = C.customer_id
INNER JOIN address D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
INNER JOIN city E ON D.city_id = E.city_id
INNER JOIN country F ON E.country_id = F.country_id
GROUP BY F.country
