Below you can find the JOIN queries I did for this SQL project

1) 
SELECT C.city,
	COUNT(A.customer_id) AS count_of_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Phillipines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10

2)
SELECT SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid,
	B.customer_id,
	B.first_name,
	B.last_name,
	D.city,
	E.country
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE city IN (
	'Aurora',
	'Shimoga',
	'Aparecida de Goinia',
	'Emeishan',
	'Pontianak',
	'Tarsus',
	'Atlixco',
	'Zalantun',
	'Rio Claro',
	'Tokat')
GROUP BY
	B.customer_id,
	B.first_name,
	B.last_name,
	D.city,
	E.country
ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC
LIMIT 5
