Below you can find some of the subqueries I performed for this SQL project

1)
SELECT first_name, 
	last_name,
	country,
	AVG(total_amount) AS avg_amount_paid
FROM 
	(SELECT B.customer_id,
		B.first_name,
		B.last_name,
		D.city,
		E.country,
	 	SUM(a.amount) AS total_amount
	FROM payment A
	INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
	INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
	INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
	INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
	WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Shimoga','Aparecida de Goinia','Emeishan','Pontianak',
			   'Tarsus', 'Atlixco','Zalantun','Rio Claro','Tokat')
	GROUP BY
		B.customer_id,
		B.first_name,
		B.last_name,
		D.city,
		E.country
	ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC
	LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid
GROUP BY first_name,
	last_name,
	country
ORDER BY avg_amount_paid DESC

2)
SELECT D.country,
	COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
	COUNT(DISTINCT top_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
LEFT JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
LEFT JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
LEFT JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN
	(SELECT SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid,
		B.customer_id,
		B.first_name,
		B.last_name,
		D.city,
		E.country
	FROM payment A
	INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
	INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
	INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
	INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
	WHERE city IN (
		'Aurora',
		'Shimoga',
		'Aparecida de Goinia',
		'Emeishan',
		'Pontianak',
		'Tarsus',
		'Atlixco',
		'Zalantun',
		'Rio Claro',
		'Tokat')
	GROUP BY
		B.customer_id,

	ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC) AS top_customers ON D.country = "top_customers".country
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
