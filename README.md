> In this repository, you will find the work that I did with SQL for one of my projects during my Data Analytics course at CareerFoundry. In the porject you will see my work with SQL as it relates to relational-databases. I worked with many commands and operators such as SELECT FROM, WHERE, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, etc. As well, you see my work with CTE's and Subquery's in the project.
