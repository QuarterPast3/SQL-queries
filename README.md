> In this repository, you will find the work that I did with SQL for one of my projects during my Data Analytics course at CareerFoundry. The project involved using SQL and relational databases to help answer business questions for a movie rental company, Rockbuster. In this repository, you will find my ability to write moderately complex SQL queries ranging from JOINS, CTEs and Subqueries. As well, being able to present my findings in a Powerpoint Presentation with visualizations from Tableau.
