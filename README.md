> In this repository, you will find the work that I did with SQL for one of my projects during my Data Analytics course at CareerFoundry. In the porject you will see my work with SQL as it relates to relational-databases. In this repository, you will find my ability to write moderately complex SQL queries ranging from JOINS, CTEs and Subqueries. As well, creating visualizations in Tableau with the information in the SQL database.
